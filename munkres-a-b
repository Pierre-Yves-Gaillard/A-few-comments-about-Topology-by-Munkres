\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Definition of $\R$ p. 31.} The object $\R$ is defined by assuming that there exists a set having certain properties. We take this assumption for granted. Then it is easy to see that there are several sets having these properties. So, let $\R'$ be a set having the same properties as $\R$. Let $\Z_+',\Z'$ and $\Q'$ be to $\R'$ what $\Z_+,\Z$ and $\Q$ are to $\R$. 

\begin{thm}\label{Tumf}
There is a unique morphism of fields from $f:\R\to\R'$. This morphism is an isomorphism of ordered fields, and it induces isomorphisms $\Z_+\to\Z_+',\Z\to\Z'$ and $\Q\to\Q'$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{lem}\label{Lgh}
There is a unique map $g:\Z_+\to\Z_+'$ such that $g(0)=0$ and $g(n+1)=g(n)+1$ for all $n$ in $\Z_+$. Similarly, there is a unique map $h:\Z_+'\to\Z_+$ such that $h(0)=0$ and $h(n+1)=h(n)+1$ for all $n$ in $\Z_+'$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} 
For $i\in\Z_+$ and $\varphi:\{1,\ldots,i\}\to\Z_+'$ define $\rho(\varphi)\in\Z_+'$ by $\rho(\varphi):=\varphi(i)+1$. Then the first statement follows from the Principle of Recursive Definition (Theorem~\ref{TPRD} p.~\pageref{TPRD}). The proof of the second statement is similar. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Tumf}] 
In the notation of Lemma \ref{Lgh}, set $u:=h\circ g$. Then $u:\Z_+\to\Z_+$ satisfies $u(0)=0$ and $u(n+1)=u(n)+1$ for all $n$ in $\Z_+$. One can easily prove that $u(n)=n$ by induction. The same argument works for $g\circ h$. This shows that $g:\Z_+\to\Z_+'$ and $h:\Z_+'\to\Z_+$ are inverse isomorphisms. Then we extend $g$ to morphisms $\Z\to\Z'$ and $\Q\to\Q'$, and similarly for $h$, and, arguing as before, we show that these morphisms are isomorphisms. More precisely, we see that there is a unique morphism $\Z\to\Z'$ extending $g$, and that this morphism is an isomorphism, and similarly for the morphism $\Q\to\Q'$. So we can make the identifications $\Z_+=\Z_+',\Z=\Z',\Q=\Q'$. To show that there is a unique morphism of fields $\R\to\R'$, and that this morphism is an isomorphism (inducing the identity of $\Q$), we argue as in Section \emph{Appendix to Chapter~1} in \emph{A few comments about ``Principles of Mathematical Analysis'' by Rudin}, available at \url{https://zenodo.org/records/13955297}.

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Exercise 7.6. p. 51.} We say that two sets $A$ and $B$ \textbf{have the same cardinality} if there is a bijection of $A$ with $B$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Show that if $B \subset A$ and if there is an injection
    \[
    f: A \to B,
    \]
    then $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality. [Hint: Define $A_1 = A, B_1 = B$, and for $n > 1$, $A_n = f(A_{n-1})$ and $B_n = f(B_{n-1})$. (Recursive definition again!) Note that $A_1 \supset B_1 \supset A_2 \supset B_2 \supset A_3 \supset \cdots$ Define a bijection $h: A \to B$ by the rule
    \[
    h(x) = \begin{cases} 
    f(x) & \text{if } x \in A_n\sm B_n \text{ for some } n, \\
    x & \text{otherwise}.]
    \end{cases}
    \]
    \item[(b)] \textit{Theorem (Schroeder-Bernstein theorem).} If there are injections $f: A \to C$ and $g: C \to A$, then $A$ and $C$ have the same cardinality.
\end{enumerate} 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} (a) We will freely use the following two obvious facts: 

(F1) For $x\in A$ and $n\in\Z_+$ we have 
$$
x\in A_n\iff f(x)\in A_{n+1}\text{ and }x\in B_n\iff f(x)\in B_{n+1}.
$$ 

(F2) We have $\bigcap_{n\ge1}A_n=\bigcap_{\ge1}B_n=:I$. 

\noi Setting $A_n':=A_n\sm B_n,B_n':=B_n\sm A_{n+1}$, we get 
$$
A=\left(\bigcup_{n\ge1}A_n'\right)\cup\left(\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n'\right)\cup I,
$$ 
and this union is disjoint. We also have 
$$
B=\left(\bigcup_{n\ge2}A_n'\right)\cup\left(\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n'\right)\cup I.
$$ 
The injection $f$ induces bijections $f_n:A_n'\to A_{n+1}'$ (here we are using (F1)). To define a bijection $h:A\to B$, it suffices to define three bijections 
$$
u:\bigcup_{n\ge1}A_n'\to\bigcup_{n\ge2}A_n',\quad v:\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n'\to\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n',\quad w:I\to I.
$$ 
We define $u$ by $u(x)=f_n(x)$ if $x\in A_n'$, and take $v$ and $w$ to be the identity maps. 

\noi(b) We set $B:=g(C)\subset A$ and define $f':A\to B$ by $f'(a):=g(f(a))$. Then $f':A\to B$ satisfies the assumptions for $f:A\to B$ in (a). \bigskip

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Exercise 8.7. p. 56.} Prove Theorem 8.4 p. 54. 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} We follow closely Section 8 of the book. Recall the statement of Theorem~8.4. 

\begin{thm}[Principle of Recursive Definition]\label{TPRD}
Let $A$ be a set; let $a_0$ be an element of $A$. Suppose $\rho$ is a function that assigns, to each function $f$ mapping a nonempty section of the positive integers into $A$, an element of $A$. Then there exists a unique function
\[h: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to A\]
such that
\[
\begin{aligned}
h(1) &= a_0,\\
h(i) &= \rho(h|{\{1,\ldots,i-1\}}) \text{ for } i > 1.
\end{aligned}
\tag{$\star$}
\]
\end{thm}

The formula $(\star)$ is called a recursion formula for $h$. It specifies $h(1)$, and it expresses the value of $h$ at $i > 1$ in terms of the values of $h$ for positive integers less than $i$. 

The first step is to prove that there exist functions defined on sections $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ that satisfy $(\star)$:

\begin{lem}\label{L8.1}
Given $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, there exists a function
\[f: \{1,\ldots,n\} \to C\]
that satisfies $(\star)$ for all $i$ in its domain.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The point of this lemma is that it is a statement that depends on $n$; therefore, it is capable of being proved by induction. Let $A$ be the set of all $n$ for which the lemma holds. We show that $A$ is inductive. It then follows that $A = \mathbb{Z}^+$.

The lemma is true for $n = 1$, since the function $f: \{1\} \to C$ defined by the equation
\[f(1) = a_0\]
satisfies $(\star)$.

Supposing the lemma to be true for $n-1$, we prove it true for $n$. By hypothesis, there is a function $f': \{1,\ldots,n-1\} \to C$ satisfying $(\star)$ for all $i$ in its domain. Define $f: \{1,\ldots,n\} \to C$ by the equations
\begin{align*}
f(i) &= f'(i) \text{ for } i \in \{1,\ldots,n-1\},\\
f(n) &= \rho(f'|{\{1,\ldots,n-1\}}).
\end{align*}

Note that this definition is an acceptable one; it does not define $f$ in terms of itself but in terms of the given function $f'$.

It is easy to check that $f$ satisfies $(\star)$ for all $i$ in its domain. The function $f$ satisfies $(\star)$ for $i \leq n-1$ because it equals $f'$ there. And $f$ satisfies $(\star)$ for $i = n$ because, by definition,
\[f(n) = \rho(f'|{\{1,\ldots,n-1\}})\]
and $f'|\{1,\ldots,n-1\}=f|\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{L8.2}
Suppose that $f: \{1,\ldots,n\} \to C$ and $g: \{1,\ldots,m\} \to C$ both satisfy $(\star)$ for all $i$ in their respective domains. Then $f(i) = g(i)$ for all $i$ in both domains.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose not. Let $i$ be the smallest integer for which $f(i) \neq g(i)$. The integer $i$ is not 1, because
\[f(1) = a_0 = g(1),\]
by $(\star)$. Now for all $j < i$, we have $f(j) = g(j)$. Because $f$ and $g$ satisfy $(\star)$,
\begin{align*}
f(i) &= \rho(f|{\{1,\ldots,n-1\}}),\\
g(i) &= \rho(g|{\{1,\ldots,n-1\}}).
\end{align*}
Since $f|\{1,\ldots,i-1\}=g|\{1,\ldots,i-1\}$, we have $f(i) = g(i)$, contrary to the choice of $i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
There exists a unique function $h: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to C$ satisfying $(\star)$ for all $i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{L8.1}, there exists for each $n$ a function that maps $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ into $C$ and satisfies $(\star)$ for all $i$ in its domain. Given $n$, Lemma~\ref{L8.2} shows that this function is unique; two such functions having the same domain must be equal. Let $f_n: \{1,\ldots,n\} \to C$ denote this unique function.

Now comes the crucial step. We define a function $h: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to C$ by defining its rule to be the union $U$ of the rules of the functions $f_n$. The rule for $f_n$ is a subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\} \times C$; therefore, $U$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^+ \times C$. We must show that $U$ is the rule for a function $h: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to C$.

That is, we must show that each element $i$ of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ appears as the first coordinate of exactly one element of $U$. This is easy. The integer $i$ lies in the domain of $f_n$ if and only if $n > i$. Therefore, the set of elements of $U$ of which $i$ is the first coordinate is precisely the set of all pairs of the form $(i,f_n(i))$, for $n \geq i$. Now Lemma~\ref{L8.2} tells us that $f_n(i) = f_m(i)$ if $n,m \geq i$. Therefore, all these elements of $U$ are equal; that is, there is only one element of $U$ that has $i$ as its first coordinate.

To show that $h$ satisfies $(\star)$ is also easy; it is a consequence of the following facts:
\begin{align*}
h(i) &= f_n(i) \text{ for } i \leq n,\\
f_n &\text{ satisfies $(\star)$ for all $i$ in its domain.}
\end{align*}

The proof of uniqueness is a copy of the proof of Lemma~\ref{L8.2}.

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Solution to Exercise 13.6 p. 83.} We must show that the topologies $\mc T_\ell$ and $\mc T_K$ are incomparable. 

\noi Claim: $[2,3)\notin\mc T_K$. Proof. If not we would have $2\in(a,b)\sm K\subset[2,3)$ for some $a$ and $b$, hence $a<2$ and $a\le2$, contradiction. 

\noi Claim: $(-1,1)\sm K\notin\mc T_\ell$. Proof. If not we would have $0\in[a,b)\subset(-1,1)\sm K\subset[2,3)$ for some $a$ and $b$, hence $a\le0<b$, hence $a<\frac1n<b$ for some $n$, contradiction. \bigskip

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Solution to Exercise 13.7 p. 83.} Let us use the following notation: 

$\T_s:=$ standard topology, 

$\T_K:=$ topology of $\R_K$, 

$\T_{fc}:=$ finite complement topology, 

$\T_u:=$ upper limit topology (having the sets $(a,b]$ as basis), 

$\T_\infty:=$ topology having the sets $(-\infty,a)$ as basis. 

\noi We denote the corresponding topological spaces by $\R_s,\R_K,\R_{fc},\R_u$ and $\R_\infty$. Finally we write $\B_s,\B_K,\B_u$ and $\B_\infty$ for the obvious bases. 

The inclusions between these five topologies on $\R$ can be summarized by the diagram 
$$
\begin{matrix}
&u\\ 
&K\\ 
&s\\ 
fc&&\infty,
\end{matrix}
$$ 
where ``$i$ below $j$'' means ``$\T_i\subsetneq\T_j$''\footnote{I denote inclusion by $\subset$ and proper inclusion by $\subsetneq$. I know that, in some sense, it would be more coherent to use $\subseteq$ for inclusion, but I prefer to do it that way, and I hope the reader will not be confused.}, and ``$i$ and $j$ on the same level'' means ``$\T_i$ and $\T_j$ are incomparable''. 

Preliminary comments: It is easy to see that the elements of $\T_\infty$ are $\varnothing$, the intervals $(-\infty,a)$, and $\R$, and to observe that $\T_\infty\cap\T_{fc}=\{\varnothing,\R\}$. It is also easy to compare the standard topology $\T_s$ to the others: the elements of $\T_{fc}$ and $\T_\infty$ are clearly open in $\R_s$, and it is plain that the intervals $(a,b)$ (which are the elements on $\B_s$) are open in $\R_K$ and in $\R_\infty$ (note that $(a,b)=\bigcup_{d<b}(a,d])$. Clearly, $(-1,1)\sm K\in\T_K$ and $(a,b]\in\T_u$ are not open in $\R_s$. Moreover $(2,3]$ is in $\T_u$ but not in $\T_K$. So, it only remains to prove $\T_K\subset\T_u$. 

Let $x$ be in $(a,b)\sm K$. It suffices to show that there is a $c$ such that $x\in(c,x]\subset(a,b)\sm K$. If $x\le0$ we set $c:=a$. If $\frac1{n+1}<x<\frac1n$ we set $c:=\frac1{n+1}\,$. If $x>1$ we set $c:=\max(1,a)$.
